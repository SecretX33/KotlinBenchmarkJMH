# Pattern and Regex compile time

### Inspiration

I've always heard that compiling a `Pattern` is slow, I just didn't know _how much_ slow it was.

## Test 1: Big Pattern

Let's start addressing the elephant in the room: big patterns. For this test, I've chosen the RFC822 compliant regex pattern for email validation ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13013056/9134906)).

## Results

_Linear scale (lower is better)._

It can be seen that the time to compile the pattern for both Java's `Pattern` and Kotlin's `Regex` is about the same: `~60Î¼s`, which is not an insane time by itself, but can scale pretty quickly if done in a loop.

## Test 2: Small Pattern

How much is `Pattern`/`Regex` compile time affected by the pattern complexity? Let's find out. For this test, I've chosen a simple pattern to validate date format.

## Results

![linear table](img/small_pattern_linear_table.png)
_Linear scale (lower is better)._

It can be seen that although inarguably the time to compile the regex pattern here is still very slow, for this small pattern it is about `~120 times` faster than the big pattern.
